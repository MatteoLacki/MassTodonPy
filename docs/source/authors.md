The project originated from the collaboration between the [Faculty of Mathematics, Informatics, and Mechanics of University of Warsaw](https://www.mimuw.edu.pl) and the [Centre for Proteomics of the University of Antwerp](https://www.uantwerpen.be/en/research-and-innovation/research-at-uantwerp/core-facilities/core-facilities/centre-for-proteomics/).

Among the people responsible for MassTodon you might find (in alphabetical order):
* Anna Gambin
* Frederik Lermyte
* Matteo Łącki
* Błażej Miasojedow
* Frank Sobott
* Michał Startek
* Dirk Valkenborg

The project wouldn't be where it is without the valuable insights of Michał Aleksander Ciach and Piotr Dittwald.

We would also like to apologize all the people that had to witness the development of the project in room 5810.

In case of any problems, please feel free to contact Matteo at matteo.lacki@gmail.com.
