Prerequisites
-------------

To play with MassTodonPy you need:
1. UNIX based operating system, either:
    * Linux, e.g. Ubuntu, Fedora, Gentoo, ...
    * macOS, e.g. Sierra
2. python2.7

To check if you have python2.7 (or later, but not 3 something yet), open your terminal and type
```{bash}
python2.7
```

You should see:

Installation
-------------

##### PIP

To install globally MassTodonPy, run in terminal
```{bash}
pip2 install MassTodonPy
```

This will install MassTodonPy and the required dependencies.
To check the installation, simply write now:

```{bash}
masstodon_example_call
```

This will run an example session of the program to check that you are able to get any output. By no means is it necessary to run it more than once, just after installation.
